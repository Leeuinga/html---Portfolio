<h3>Spiderman: into the spiderverse</h3>
<p>The cinematics and design of the movie is above any other movie i have ever seen. The way the director was able to make the movie seem like an animated comic book is cool</p>

<h3>Step Brothers</h3>
<p>Funny as hell</p>

<h3>Thor: Ragnorak</h3>
<p>Funny and fits the super hero theme that we all know and love</p>
